* saos-wf-enrich
  Prototype enrichment workflow for SAOS system

** Installation
   + Install Oracle Java 7+
   + Install lein2
   + Clone saos-wf-enrich GitHub repo
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     git clone --recursive https://github.com/CeON/saos-wf-enrich/
     #+END_SRC
   + Run top level ~bld.sh~ script
   + Copy ~law_journal_dict.json.gz~ to ~ext~ directory
   + Prepare ~config~ file based on template
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     cp config.example config
     #+END_SRC
     Edit ~config~, providing put and get URLs +  authorization credentials

** Running
   Enricher comes with three scripts:

   + run.sh :: the main entry point for running analysis and putting results
     back. For periodic updates of enrichment tags, add it to crontab
     The results are logged to two files:

   + get.sh :: Download the data via REST (do not process them)

   + put.sh :: Put the calculated data to the server (useful if you want to
     resend existing data)

   The following files log information about enrichment
   +  get.log :: log for downloading data via REST

   +  bob.log :: log for processing data

   +  put/rest/out/put_json.log :: stores the response from the
      server, obtained after doing REST PUT with the results. Correct
      response should look like this:
      #+BEGIN_SRC js
       {:code 200, :message OK, :content {"status":"OK",
         "message":"Enrichment tags successfully uploaded","details":""}}
      #+END_SRC
** Troubleshooting
*** How do I run the enricher on the machine with IPv6?

    Set the environment variable ~JVM_OPTS~ to the following value
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    JVM_OPTS="-Djava.net.preferIPv6Addresses=true"
    #+END_SRC
